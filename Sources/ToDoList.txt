=== Function Optimization Ideas ===
Local optimizations.
Local optimizations applicable to individual basic block, so the blocks without any extra receivers in the middle.

Note that constant folding is not applicable as there no compile time constants in the logic circuit.
Remove double NOTs if there is no another receiver between them.
Remove or simplify functions receiving same parameter.
Simplify Function followed by another function if there is no another receiver between them.
Eliminate common sub expressions.
Grouping up few primitive functions to complex one (dynamically built?) if there is no another receivers in the middle.

Global optimizations.


=== Feature not implementing ===
Power up root: to much hassle to start up the runtime.
For example if user has circuit that is not on the execution tree. or when the execution tree has multiple of current circuits.
